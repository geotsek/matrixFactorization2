In this repo I put together python code to perform matrix factorization using funk-svd. funk-svd is a old famous matrix factorization method for recommender systems, and was specifically developed for the Netflix problem.

I employ funk-svd for the non-square matrix of genes and diseases (doid = disease ontology id). The relevant data came from OMIM.
